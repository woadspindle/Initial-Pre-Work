/*4.30: Counting in JS is zero-based, meaning you start counting at the zero(th) index and then go to one, two, etc. Bracket notation is one way of telling JS to look at a specific character or group of characters in a string. */

// Example
var firstLetterOfFirstName = "";
var firstName = "Ada";

firstLetterOfFirstName = firstName[0];

// Setup
var firstLetterOfLastName = "";
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line
firstLetterOfLastName = lastName[0];
